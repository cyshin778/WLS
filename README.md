# WLS

This project aims to discover major risk factors on depression and moderation effect of polygenic risk scores between personal resource, social support, social participation and late-life depression, using multivariate linear regression, GSCA(Generalized Structured Component Analysis) and H2O AutoML, leveraging the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) data. My final goal in this project is to establish a Polysocial Risk Score (PsRS) so that we can measure an individual's risk for late-life depression with socioeconomic and personality factors.
